# Known Bitcoin Pools

Known Bitcoin mining pool coinbase tags and coinbase output addresses.

For maintainability, the data is defined as a JSON-file per pool in the `pools/`
folder. For each pool, the following information is included in the JSON file:

```JSON
{
  "id": "examplepool",
  "name": "Example Pool",
  "addresses": [
    "15kDhRAcpgsugmh6mQsTcCHdvbsuYncEEV",
    "bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "/example/",
    "Example Pool"
  ],
  "link": "https://example.com"
}
```

The JSON files aren't intended for direct consumption by tools trying to
identify mining pools. The format may change. Rather, the data in the
JSON-files should be used to generate a file suitable for consumption by
down-stream tools. An example is the `contrib/generate-old-pools-json.py`
script which generates `generated/pools.json`. This file was previously
used to collect the coinbase tags and addresses and is still used by some
tools.
